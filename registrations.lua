------Story NPC Registrations------

--
-- story_npc:wand

-- story_npc:tome

-- Auto generates Entity registrations based on the number of 
-- files present in the models folder

-- You can change the model's textures using normal edit commands, but not the object file, 
-- hence why I have so many registrations. Luckily, it's possible to swap entities and reload 
-- in their assoicated event data and setup

--For loop based on number of files

--Register

--End for loop
